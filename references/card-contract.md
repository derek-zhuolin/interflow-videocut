# Card Contract — Step 8 reference

This is the full body of **Step 8 (Write Each Card's HTML)**, moved out of
`SKILL.md` to keep the workflow skeleton light. Read it when you reach Step 8.
It covers: the clone-first default, the card HTML contract + hard rules,
NON-NEGOTIABLE overflow safety, portrait sizing, the silky motion philosophy,
the `data-anim` kinds table, and the `card-cta` brand-outro template.

## Clone-first (the default — read before writing anything)

For each card:

1. `cp "$SKILL_DIR/references/styles/<styleKey>.html" "$WORK_DIR/public/cards/<card-id>.html"`
   — `<styleKey>` = the card's `styleKey` if set, else the film's **primary**
   style (see the style-family note in Step 7; accent cards may pull a
   same-family sibling).
2. Rename the fragment's `data-card-id="ref-<key>"` to this card's `<card-id>`
   (update the scoped `<style>` selectors + element ids to match).
3. Swap the placeholder copy for this card's real `contentHints` text, and set
   the accent to the card's `accentIndex`.
4. **Compose, don't just fill — but hold the style's DNA.** The quality floor is
   the style's **design tokens**, not its fixed arrangement. Keep fixed: the
   fonts, the theme palette / `var(--accent-N)`, the ornament vocabulary, the
   spacing scale, and — NON-NEGOTIABLE — the overflow guards (clamp sizing,
   `max-width`, `overflow-wrap`; see below). **Within that envelope you are free
   to recompose the fragment to serve this card's point**: promote or demote the
   emphasis, switch stacked ↔ two-column, move the panel (bottom / centered /
   side), drop a slot the card doesn't need, change the shape to match the
   content (a number wants a big figure; a comparison wants two columns; a quote
   wants centered). Two adjacent cards should **not** be structurally identical
   when their content differs — sameness across cards is the defect this skill
   most often ships. Over a talking head, a recomposed block must still **keep
   the speaker's face clear** (a deliberate full-dim statement beat is the one
   allowed exception, used sparingly).

What stays off-limits: re-picking fonts, recoloring off the theme, importing a
foreign ornament, or breaking the overflow contract. Authoring a fragment from a
blank file is still the **exception**, not the routine — recomposition starts
from the cloned fragment so the tokens come along for free. The contract below
documents what a valid fragment looks like (so you can validate a clone, recompose
it, or author the rare bespoke card).

Each file contains a single rooted HTML fragment that follows this contract:

## Card HTML Contract

```html
<div class="card" data-card-id="{cardId}">
  <style>
    /* MUST: every rule starts with .card[data-card-id="{cardId}"] */
    .card[data-card-id="card-01"] .root {
      width: 100%; height: 100%;
      display: flex; ...;
      font-family: 'Caveat', 'LXGW WenKai TC', serif;
      color: var(--text);
      background: var(--bg);
    }
    .card[data-card-id="card-01"] .title { font-size: 84px; ... }
  </style>

  <div class="root">
    <h1 id="card-01-title"
        data-anim="kinetic-chars"
        data-anim-at="0.3"
        data-anim-duration="0.5"
        data-anim-stagger="0.04"
        data-anim-pattern="pop">
      <span class="char">字</span>
      <span class="char">幕</span>
    </h1>
    <div id="card-01-line"
         data-anim="grow-x"
         data-anim-at="0.65"
         data-anim-duration="0.5"
         data-anim-target-w="420"
         style="width:0;height:8px;background:var(--accent-0);border-radius:4px;"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Hard rules** (`hyperframes` lint will reject violations):

- Single root `<div class="card" data-card-id="{cardId}">`
- Inline `<style>` rules MUST be prefixed with the scope selector above
- **No `<script>` tags**
- **No external URLs** in `src=` / `href=` (no CDN, no remote fonts)
- **No inline event handlers** (`onclick=` etc.)
- All assets via relative paths into the same `public/` directory
- Colors via `var(--accent-N)` etc. for portability across themes

> **These hard rules govern CARD fragments.** The composition `index.html` itself
> legitimately carries `<script>` (the GSAP block) — and MAY also drive a
> background `<canvas>` atmosphere layer (e.g. `nebula-glass`'s flow-field particle
> field) **under one strict condition: the canvas draw must be a closed-form
> function of the timeline time `draw(t)` and be driven by the master timeline's
> `onUpdate` (a proxy tween whose value === time), NOT by `requestAnimationFrame`
> or accumulated per-frame state.** No `Math.random()` / `Date.now()` inside
> `draw` (seed particle init once with a PRNG like mulberry32 instead). This keeps
> the canvas deterministic under HyperFrames' seek-based capture — verified: two
> snapshots at the same `t` are byte-identical. The full copy-paste recipe lives in
> `references/styles/nebula-glass.html`'s header. Cards stay script-free; only the
> composition shell hosts the canvas.

## Overflow safety — NON-NEGOTIABLE (the #1 cause of broken cards)

Text that overruns its card is the most common defect — a long headline
silently clips or pushes the layout off-canvas, and you won't see it until
render. **Build every card overflow-proof by construction**, not by eyeballing:

- The `.root` MUST set `overflow: hidden` and `box-sizing: border-box`.
- Every text block gets an explicit `line-height` (never rely on the default),
  a `max-width` (≤ its zone width, see the zone table), and
  `overflow-wrap: anywhere` so a long word can't shove past the edge.
- Size hero text with `clamp(min, Ncqi, max)` (container-query units) so it
  shrinks on narrow frames instead of overflowing — **not** a fixed `px`.
- Add `text-wrap: balance` to multi-line headlines for even line lengths.
- NEVER use `white-space: nowrap` on content text. If you must (a kicker/chip),
  cap it with `max-width` + `text-overflow: ellipsis`.
- If a card holds a lot of copy, that's a signal to **split it into two cards**,
  not to shrink the font until it fits.

```css
/* paste into every card's .root and text rules — adjust the clamp ceilings */
.card[data-card-id="card-01"] .root  { overflow: hidden; box-sizing: border-box; }
.card[data-card-id="card-01"] .title { font-size: clamp(48px, 8cqi, 120px);
  line-height: 1.15; max-width: 92%; overflow-wrap: anywhere; text-wrap: balance; }
.card[data-card-id="card-01"] .body  { font-size: clamp(20px, 3cqi, 40px);
  line-height: 1.5; max-width: 90%; overflow-wrap: anywhere; }
```

Per-zone `max-width` ceiling (portrait 1080-wide reference):

| zone | usable width | text `max-width` |
|---|---|---|
| `fullscreen` | full − margins | ~92% (≈ 940px) |
| `lower-third` | full − margins | ~94% (≈ 1000px) |
| `side-panel` (split) | half − gap | ~46cqi (≈ 480px) |

**Animations are declared, not coded.** Use `data-anim-*` attributes
only; never write `<script>` to animate. You compile every `data-anim-*`
declaration into the single master GSAP timeline in Step 9.

## Card Sizing — Mobile-First in Portrait

The 11 `references/styles/*.html` are sized for a **1920×1080 landscape**
preview. When `storyboard.layout = "portrait"` (1080×1920, the dominant
case for social / mobile), **scale every visual size up** — phones hold
the screen close, and the same pixel count reads smaller than on a
landscape TV-style canvas.

| token | landscape baseline | **portrait target** | scale |
|---|---|---|---|
| title (h1/h2 hero) | 64–96px | **88–132px** | ×1.35 |
| detail / body | 24–30px | **30–40px** | ×1.30 |
| kicker / chip label | 14–16px | **18–22px** | ×1.30 |
| timecode / meta | 12–14px | **16–18px** | ×1.30 |
| data block primary number | 48–60px | **64–88px** | ×1.40 |
| line-height multiplier | 1.05–1.5 | same | (don't scale) |

**Rule of thumb:** `portraitPx = round(landscapePx × 1.3)`, then floor
to a nearby 4px multiple for visual rhythm. Hero headlines may go up to
×1.4; small meta text stays at ×1.2 to avoid crowding.

Padding **shrinks slightly** in portrait — the card is narrower so big
landscape padding (40–64px) eats too much width. Use 24–36px horizontal
padding in portrait.

If you're producing a single card that must work in **both** layouts,
prefer a `@container` query on the card root over hard-coding sizes:

```css
.card[data-card-id="X"] .root { container-type: inline-size; }
.card[data-card-id="X"] .title { font-size: clamp(64px, 8.5cqi, 132px); }
.card[data-card-id="X"] .detail { font-size: clamp(24px, 3.2cqi, 40px); }
```

But for most cards, a single layout choice is fine — just pick the size
table column that matches the storyboard's `layout` field.

## Motion Philosophy — the default is *silky*, not slideshow

**Read this before authoring any animation. It overrides the old "fade in →
freeze → fade out" instinct.** The film should feel like one continuous
camera move with cards flowing through it, *not* a deck of slides that pop
on and off. Four defaults make this happen:

1. **Overlapping transitions, never a hard cut.** Adjacent cards overlap
   ~0.5–0.6s. The outgoing card slides up + blurs + fades while the incoming
   card sinks in from below — one continuous "slip", not card-A-gone-then-card-B.
   (This is why Step 9's timing rule now *wants* overlap, see below.)
2. **Nothing freezes after it lands.** Every card carries a slow ambient
   `drift` so the frame is always subtly alive. Amplitude is tiny (≤12px or
   ≤0.6°) and the period is long (8–14s) — you should *feel* it, not *watch* it.
3. **Continuous easing.** Default entrances to `expo.out` / `power3.out` (was
   `power2.out`); transitions and `#video-wrap` framing to `power3.inOut`.
   Damped, weighty motion reads as "silk"; linear/snappy reads as "PowerPoint".
4. **One persistent anchor.** `#video-wrap` (the talking-head) is the single
   element that never cuts across the whole film. When it reframes, its move
   shares the *same start time and same ease* as the card transition, so the
   camera and the card slide as one gesture.

**恰到好处 guardrails — restraint is the point (tasteful > busy):**
- **One primary transition gesture per cut.** Don't stack a slide + a spin + a
  zoom; pick the slip and let it breathe.
- **≤2 persistent motions on screen at once** (e.g. one `drift` + the aurora
  backdrop). More than that and the eye has nowhere to rest.
- **Ambient motion must never out-move the speaker.** The drift is wallpaper,
  not a performer — if it competes with the talking-head, halve it.
- **Key info holds still ≥1.5s.** Once a number, headline, or takeaway has
  landed, it stays readable and static long enough to actually read.

These are *defaults for every style*. The per-style recipes in
`references/styles/*.html` and `references/DESIGN_INDEX.md` (see its **Motion**
section) layer texture on top, but the slip-transition + ambient-drift +
shared-camera spine is universal.

## Available `data-anim` Kinds

| kind | use for | key params |
|---|---|---|
| `fade-in` | enter | `at`, `duration`, `ease?` |
| `fade-out` | exit | `at`, `duration`, `ease?` |
| `slide-in` | slide enter | `at`, `duration`, `from=left\|right\|top\|bottom`, `distance` |
| `kinetic-chars` | per-char pop | `at`, `duration`, `stagger`, `pattern=pop\|fade` — element needs `<span class="char">` children |
| `typewriter` | per-char fade | same as kinetic-chars but slower default stagger |
| `count-up` | animate number | `at`, `duration`, `from`, `to`, `format=.0f\|.1f\|.2f\|,d` |
| `draw-path` | SVG path reveal | `at`, `duration` — element should be a `<path>` |
| `grow-y` | bar height | `at`, `duration`, `target-h` (px) — element starts `height:0` |
| `grow-x` | bar width | `at`, `duration`, `target-w` (px) — element starts `width:0` |
| `scale-pop` | pop entrance | `at`, `duration` |
| `blur-in` | unfocused → focused | `at`, `duration` |
| `mask-reveal` | clip reveal | `at`, `duration`, `direction=left\|right\|top\|bottom` |
| `morph-to` | tween any CSS | `at`, `duration`, `props='{...JSON...}'` |
| `settle` | **default entrance** — damped landing, no overshoot | `at`, `duration`, `from=bottom\|left\|right\|top` (default bottom), `distance` (default 28) |
| `parallax-in` | entrance that keeps a slow drift after landing (depth feel) | `at`, `duration`, `from`, `distance`, `axis=x\|y`, `amp`, `period` |
| `drift` | **ambient — runs forever, no end** — keeps the frame alive | `axis=x\|y\|rotate`, `amp` (≤12px / ≤0.6°), `period` (8–14s) |

**Entrance default:** prefer `settle` over `slide-in`/`scale-pop` for body
content (`expo.out`, no bounce — reads as silk). Reserve `scale-pop`'s bounce
for a single deliberate accent, not every element.

**`drift` is not an entrance** — it has no `at`/`duration`; it's an ambient
yoyo loop (`yoyo:true, sine.inOut`) you attach to the card root (or a hero
element) so nothing freezes after landing. **Use a FINITE repeat** sized to the
composition — `repeat: Math.ceil(compDurationSec / legSec)` — never `repeat:-1`
(the deterministic capture engine forbids infinite repeats; see the Step-9
checklist rule). Max one or two per card (see 恰到好处 guardrails above).

`data-anim-at` is **seconds relative to the card's startSec** — when you
compile each declaration into the GSAP timeline in Step 9, add the
card's `startSec` to get the absolute time and quantize to 1/fps. Default
eases are now **`expo.out` (entrance), `power2.in` (exit), `power3.inOut`
(transition / `#video-wrap`)** — see the cheat sheet.

## card-cta: Brand Outro Card (dark default — RE-THEME to match the composition)

> Use this template **as-is only for dark/cinematic compositions.** For a
> light or otherwise-styled video, re-theme it per the "outro must follow
> the same visual language" note in Step 6: keep the structure + entrance
> choreography, swap the palette to the composition's `--bg` / `--ink` /
> `--accent-0`, and swap the mark / wordmark / tagline (or drop the brand
> entirely if the user asked). "Do not modify" below means *don't break the
> animation rig* — colors and copy are meant to be adapted.

Save this template as `$WORK_DIR/public/cards/card-cta.html`
. Design language: **"Editorial Cinema"** — viewfinder corner
marks, top/bottom film-credit meta strips, a dual rotating ring around a
neutral play-mark, a diamond-flanked divider, an italic tagline, a **recap /
payoff line** that opens the card, and a one-line **purpose / 延伸** statement
under the wordmark. The whole card is **flex-centered inside a safe area** and
spaced with `gap`+`clamp` (not fixed margins), so the content column never
collides with the pinned corners / meta strips in 9:16, 4:5 *or* 16:9 — and
every text block carries `max-width` + `overflow-wrap` guards. The entrance is
**calm and slow on purpose** (~2.7s, ~6 grouped beats — far fewer than a
content card) so the ending settles instead of competing for the eye: recap
(0.55s) → mark (1.05s) → wordmark (1.42s) → purpose (1.80s) → sign-off
(2.15s); ~0.4s hold (ring rotation only) + ~0.35s fade-out, total ~3.5s.
It ships **branded with the Interflow club sign-off** (`你只管讲，成片交给我们`
recap + `Interflow` wordmark + `让每个想法，都有更好的呈现` purpose +
`Interflow AI 出品` tagline + neutral play-mark). **Rewrite the `.recap` line
from what the video actually said** — that's the content beat. Keep as-is
otherwise for club work; to re-brand for an outside creator, swap the wordmark
/ tagline / mark (or delete the wordmark for a clean ending). Keep the
animation rig intact.
